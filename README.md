# Air Quality and Superfund Sites in Los Angeles, California
### GEOG 485: GIS Programming
### Spring 2024

## About
Superfund sites are abandoned contaminated lands designated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). These sites are targetted by the EPA to force a clean up of the area, either by those responsible or by the EPA itself, after being reimbursed by those in charge of the site.

As of March 7th, 2024, there are a total of 1,340 sites across the U.S.

Since Superfund sites are sites of pollution I was curious to know if there would be a significant change in air quality near these sites. For the sake of the project, only nitrogen dioxide (NO2) emissions will be examined.

Research Question: Is there a relationship between NO2 emissions and the location of superfund sites?

## Conclusion

Overall there is a consistent concentration along the Superfund site locations, but they are not significantly large emissions around the sites. There are other factors that may contribute to the higher emissions such as increased traffic. Therefore we cannot conclude that the emissions are directly caused by the sites.

Additionally, since characteristics of Superfund sites vary, some sites may release other air pollutants asides from NO2. NO2 emissions are primarily from the burning of fuel, such as from vehicles, power plants, and off road equipment. As these are the main sources of NO2, it is understandable if most Superfund sites emit another air pollutant that is not reflected in this project. Superfund sites may also have a greater effect on the soil rather than the air, with contaminants such as lead, asbestos, and radiation.
